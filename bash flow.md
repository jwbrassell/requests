**Request:** I am looking for a bash script that will allow me to output a box for each item in a list. In the below example, list is contains "TEXT 1", "TEXT 2", "TEXT 3".


```
+--------+    +--------+    +--------+
| TEXT 1 | -> | TEXT 2 | -> | TEXT 3 | 
+--------+    +--------+    +--------+ 
```

+ I would like this to:
  - adjust the box around the text to scale with the text. 
  - keep consistent spacing between text
  - no need to pass the list to the script. The list can be hardcoded in. 
  - output stdout. no need to save to file.
